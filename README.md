# Smart_Expenses_Tracker
A Python-based web application built with the Flask framework to help users track and manage daily expenses. It features secure user registration and login, intuitive forms to add, edit, and delete expenses, and categorized expense views for better organization. The system uses SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for secure data storage, while HTML, CSS, and Jinja2 were used to design responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
